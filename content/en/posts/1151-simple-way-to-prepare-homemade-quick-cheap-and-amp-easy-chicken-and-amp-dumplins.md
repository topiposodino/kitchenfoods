recipeingredient:
- "4 can biscuits"
- "1 packages Boneless Chicken"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chunk chicken into cubes and throw in a LARGE pan half full of water.  Heat on medium. *I usually use 2 or 3 chicken breasts. Adjust to your likings depending on how meaty youd like."
- "Unwrap  3-4 cans of biscuits. These are the best for this dish, store brand is fine! *I use all 4 as my favorite part is the dumplins. If you are making this for a smaller crowd, you can use less. But, i promise you, you want a lot since it breaks down some."
- "Cut biscuits into quarters. I use 4 cans. It looks like a lot, but they boil down in the pan some!"
- "Throw biscuits into pan with the chicken &amp; water."
- "Bump up the heat a little so it can boil a few mins."
- "Stir, stir, and stir some more. Break apart the gooey lumps of conjoined biscuit. It looks slimy and seems like you ruined the meal, but nope! Just stir frequently so that it doesnt boil over and turn to a single blob."
- "Once the biscuits start firming up and the chicken isnt pink on the outside, turn to low and simmer. Stir occasionally. Add your choice of seasonings. I usually use garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper. Celery salt makes a great addition, it is in my seasoning salt."
- "Chicken &amp; dumplins are done when chicken is cooked , biscuits arent a slimy mess, and the broth has thickened."
- "Fill a big bowl and enjoy! I usually serve with by itself. Good  sides would be peas and carrots (which you could throw in the pot too if youd like) and some french bread."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
