recipeingredient:
- "2 Chicken thighs"
- "5 cm piece Carrot"
- "8 Green beans"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "1 Plastic wrap"
- "1 whatever is available Juice leftover from cooking the chicken"
- "3 tbsp Sake"
- "2 tbsp Mirin"
- "2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the carrots the same thickness as the green beans.  Butterfly the chicken thighs in thick places to even out the thickness overall."
- "Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper.  Lay out the carrots and green beans, and wrap the meat into a roll around them.  Wrap the roll with plastic wrap."
- "Make sure one end of the plastic wrap is loose so that air can go through.  This will stop the wrap from bursting during cooking."
- "Set the roll on a microwavable dish, and heat at 600 w for 3 minutes.  Turn the rolls and microwave for 2 additional minutes. When the rolls have cooked, collect any juices that have seeped out.  Combine the chicken juices, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar in a frying pan and mix them together while heating."
- "Add the chicken rolls to the frying pan and roll them around in the cooking sauce."
- "Thoroughly coat the rolls with the sauce (steps 4~6 in the frying pan should take about 2 minutes)"
- "Cut the rolls to your desired thickness."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
