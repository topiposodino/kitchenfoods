recipeinstructions:
- "This time, I chose Chinese cabbage to serve with the chicken. Cut the core part of the Chinese cabbage into thick matchsticks if you can. But you can cut into your desired shape and size."
- "Put the Chinese cabbage into a heat resistant dish. Cover with cling film and microwave for 4 minutes at 600 W until slightly wilted."
- "Drain the Chinese cabbage in a colander."
- "Grate, chop or julienne the ginger, and combine with the seasonings. Marinate the meat with this ginger sauce."

- "Microwave for 6 minutes at 600 W. Check the chicken by looking at it from the bottom of the dish, or poke with your finger to see if it&#39;s done. If it&#39;s not, microwave it again, 30 seconds at a time."
- "The cling film might tear a little. Sometimes, it gets burnt a little as well. Remove from the microwave, and leave it to rest for about 15 minutes."
- "By letting the meat sit for a while, you can keep the moisture on the inside to make it juicy. Thinly slice the chicken."
- "The marinade sauce left in the dish is going to be the sauce to pour over the meat and vegetables."
- "This is how I served the chicken before I pour over the sauce. You can use any vegetables you like instead of Chinese cabbage to serve with the chicken It also goes well with raw vegetables."
- "You can serve it with the sauce like this. The sauce is quite sweet. Adjust it to your liking. It tastes even better if you add grated garlic with the ginger."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
