recipeingredient:
- "1 Chicken breast"
- "2 tbsp Shiokoji salt fermented rice malt"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Spread the chicken breast on a microwave-safe plate, and rub the shio-koji and olive in very well."
- "When you are in a hurry you can just cook the chicken as-is, but if possible leave it to marinate in the refrigerator for more than 6 hours. The longer you let it rest in the marinade, the more its flavor and texture will improve."
- "You can leave it to marinate topped with bay leaves and so on if you like."
- "Cover the plate tightly with plastic wrap, and microwave for 6 minute s at 600w."
- "The plastic wrap will rip and the chicken will become slightly browned. Leave it as-is to cool and rest for about 20 minutes if possible. This will settle the juices in the chicken."
- "You can eat microwaved chicken even when it&#39;s cold. You can slice it the next day too. It can be warmed up a bit in the microwave just before eating."
- "Slice thinly or thickly as you like. Use the leftover juices to pour over the chicken or use as a dipping sauce."
- ""
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
