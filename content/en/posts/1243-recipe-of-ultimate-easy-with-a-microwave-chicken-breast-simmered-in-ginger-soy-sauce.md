- "1 Chicken breast"
- "1 tbsp  Grated ginger"
- "1 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp  Sake"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 dash Chopped green onion for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rub the chicken breast meat with sugar and leave for a while. This makes the meat tender and juicy."
- "Combine the ingredients marked ★ (grated ginger, soy sauce, sake). If you don&#39;t have fresh ginger use pre-grated ginger from a tube - it will still be good."
- "Wash the sugar off the chicken. Pat dry with paper towels, and line up in a heatproof container skin side down.   Pour the combined ★ ingredients evenly over the chicken."
- "Loosely cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 4 minutes at 500-600 W."
- "Take the container out. It will look like the photo. The top side of the chicken is not cooked yet, so turn it over and microwave for a further 2 minutes. (If you are using a 500 W oven keep checking and add some cooking time if needed.)"
- "Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a serving plate. Pour the remaining sauce over the chicken, garnish with chopped green onions on top and it&#39;s done! Eat while dipping in the sauce."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
