- "Take the rice out of the microwave and stir the rice with a cut-and-fold motion. Wherever the egg has clumped together, make sure to break it apart. Cover the plate in cling film once again and microwave it for 2 minutes at 500 W."
- "Take the plate out of the microwave once more and stir the rice in the same cut-and-fold motion again to make it nice and crumbly. Then put the rice in the microwave for a further 1 minute at 500 W to evaporate off any excess liquid."
- "Take the rice out of the microwave a final time and stir it again. Then season the rice with salt and pepper and serve."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
