- "2 lb Chicken Breast"
- " Herbed Poultry Celery Seed Rosemary Garlic Powder or any other seasonings you prefer"
- " Asparagus"
- " Parmesan Cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse chicken &amp; lay across bottom of Crock Pot. Generously add seasonings to your liking. Cook on High for 5 hours then switch to low for remaining 2-3 hours; depending on thickness of breast. Thicker breasts will need to cook longer than thinner ones. Adjust your time accordingly so it&#39;s not dry when served. It&#39;s done cooking when juices run clear &amp; the inside is white; no longer pink. Remember to occasionally turn chicken over from side to side."
- "Rinse Asparagus and pat dry about an hour before chicken is ready to serve. Lay across top of chicken. Season to your liking. Cook for remaining 60-90 minutes depending on how crispy vs soft you like it. It will steam to a perfect crispness for you."
- "Serve straight from Crock or place upon serving dish/plate. I like to add a small amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the Asparagus before serving. Your family or guests will be pleasantly surprised with how well this stupid easy meal tastes!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
