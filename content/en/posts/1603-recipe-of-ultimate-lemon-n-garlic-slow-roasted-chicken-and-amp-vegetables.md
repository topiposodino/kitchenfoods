recipeinstructions:
- "Clean the chicken thighs as best as you can, leaving the skin on."

- "Pre-heat the oven to 160 degrees C."
- "In a baking tray, mix the cubed vegetables, lemon pieces and garlic cloves (leave the skin on the garlic cloves, just remove the thin papery bits)."
- "Add enough salt n pepper to season, and toss in whatever herbs you want to use (i usually go with rosemary and thyme). drizzle with olive oil and mix everything well."
- "Spread the seasoned veggies evenly in the tray. place the marinated chicken pieces skin side up on top of the vegetables."

- "After 2 hours, remove the tray from the oven and set the oven temperature to 200 degrees C."
- "Remove the aluminum foil cover (be SUPER careful with this, because steam will escape when you remove the foil) and discard."
- "Place the tray back into the oven and let it bake uncovered for 30 minutes. at the end of this time, the chicken will be moist and tender, and the chicken skin will have become crisp and golden brown."
- "Let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes before serving. since the dish contains potatoes you don&#39;t really need bread or any other accompaniment, except maybe for a salad. one-pot-wonder folks!!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
