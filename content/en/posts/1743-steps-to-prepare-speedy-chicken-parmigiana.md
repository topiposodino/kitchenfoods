recipeingredient:
- "2 lb Chicken Breast"
- "1 1/2 cup AP Flour"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 pinch crushed black pepper"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 1/2 cup Panko"
- "3 tbsp Olive Oil"
- "2 cup Tomato Sauce"
- " About 1 cup of cheese grated parmesan mozarella or both"
recipeinstructions:
- "You want to flatten out your chicken breast to start off. The traditional method seems to be to just pound it flat with a meat tenderizer or a heavy skillet. I like to butterfly my chicken cutlets though. If you don&#39;t plan on overcooking your chicken, it doesn&#39;t need to be pulverized, and it will stay nice and juicy. I lay the breast flat and slice into the mid-section through the thickest part, peeling it opened as I go, just like If you were planning to make stuffed chicken breast or cordon bleu."
- "Prepare your dredging platters. Lay out three shallow dishes. In one, add flour, salt, and pepper, and mix it up. In the next, crack 2 eggs, and whisk them up. In the third, spread out your panko. You can use regular breadcrumbs if you can&#39;t find panko, but I love panko."
- "Place a piece of chicken in the flour and make sure it is coated well. Dust it off just a bit and move it to the egg. Again, make sure it is coated well. Now, into the panko, turning and pressing down a couple of times, making sure that the whole piece of chicken is well coated. Repeat the process with your other chicken pieces. With 2 lbs of chicken breast, you&#39;ll probably get 2-3 big pieces."
- "Heat olive oil in a non-stick pan. You can cook these bad Larry&#39;s on medium-low. I like to cook them pretty slow to get a good golden crisp on both sides, and by this time the chicken should be cooked mostly through depending on how thick you left your cutlets."
- "Preheat your oven to 350F"
- "Warm your tomato sauce gently on the stove. I always make my own sauce. Check out my marinara recipe if you&#39;re interested, it&#39;s very simple."
- "When your chicken cutlets are golden, arrange them in a baking platter large enough to accommodate them without any overlap."
- "Spread some tomato sauce over the chicken cutlets."
- "Top with cheese."
- "Place in the oven for about 10 minutes. You just want the cheese to melt, and maybe, if your chicken was pretty thick, to finish cooking it through. If you&#39;re confident that your chicken is cooked through, I would recommend broiling instead, just to turn the cheese golden crusty brown. There&#39;s really no flavor like that caramel crusty cheese flavor."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
