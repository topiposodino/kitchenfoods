recipeingredient:
- "2 to 3 boneless  skinless chicken breasts"
- "1 packages bacon"
- "2 to 4 cups of shredded mexican mixed cheese   you can use cheddar or any other kind "
- "3 cloves of minced garlic"
- "3 tbsp butter   I used unsalted "
- "1 cup milk"
- "2 tbsp flour"
- "3/4 cup of ranch dressing"
- "1 packages any kind of noodles"
- "1 extra flour if needed   I ended up using 3 tablespoons because of how much bacon grease I used "
- "1 salt to taste if desired"
- "1 pepper to taste if desired"
- "2 to 3 chicken bouillon cubes if boiling the chicken"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a saucepan,  put your chicken breasts in, add in 2 chicken bullion cubes and water. Boil until cooked through.  Set chicken on a plate to cool so you can cube it later. You can also fry or bake your chicken if you prefer."
- "Cook your bacon crispy or until cooked through.  I prefer cripsy because when baking it later it can get mushy. Reserve some of the grease. Place bacon on a plate lined with paper towels."
- "Cube up your chicken as soon as it is cool enough to touch. (  please excuse my husband&#39;s hands hahaha )"
- "Mince up your garlic cloves.  If you use garlic powder, I am not sure how much would equal to 3 cloves. I find it easier personally to slice the garlic into thin match stick like and then start dicing it as tiny as I can."
- "Chop up your bacon ."
- "Put some bacon grease into a frying pan.  I honestly don&#39;t know how much I used. Add in garlic and butter. Melt the butter, and keep a close eye not to burn the garlic or let it get brown. I cooked it for about 4 minutes."
- "Add cubed chicken into the frying pan with your garlic, grease and butter. Mix around until chicken has been coated. Add in your flour. Mix well until it is thick and not runny on the chicken pieces.  If there is still liquid,  use a little bit more flour. Mixing well."
- "Add in your chopped bacon,  and mix."
- "Boil your noodles. I add a little bit of oil or butter and salt to my water.  Drain, do not rinse."
- "Heat oven to 350°F."
- "Add in your ranch dressing,  mixing well.  Add milk and mix well. Cook on low to medium until this thickens up some."
- "After it is thicker, add in about 1 cup of cheese. Mix together."
- "Add in drained noodles,  a little at a time. These measurements do not use the entire package of noodles.  Mix as you add, so that all of them added are coated and you don&#39;t have extra that will have little to no sauce."
- "Place the entire mixture into a casserole dish. Place in the oven for approximately 15 minutes uncovered."
- "Take the dish out of the oven.  Cover with cheese. As much or as little as you like. Place it back into the oven and bake uncovered until the cheese is nice and gooey."
- "Serve hot with bread, salad, or any other side you like.  Enjoy !!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
