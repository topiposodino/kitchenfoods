recipeinstructions:
- "I layered mine in crockpot, starting with Rotel, then 1 can of each, as well as half of the veggies, and half taco seasoning, then repeated with the rest."
- "Continue to layer it with 1 can of each and rest of taco seasoning and diced veg/herbs. Then add the shredded chicken on top, since it&#39;s already cooked. Set to high."
- "Top with cream cheese. Make sure to cut into pieces and put them evenly throughout on top all around. Once it starts melting, give it all-A GOOD STIR. Then add the garlic powder, salt and cracked pepper. Stir again. And continue to check on it from time to time and stir, making sure the cream cheese has no lumps:)"

Tip 2:I made steamed rice, and added taco seasoning to the water and stir it before I put in my rice cooker. Tip 3: once rice is done, add your rice to your plate, top with the crockpot mixture, and you can top it with queso dip, shredded Mexican blend cheese, some of the green onions, and a lil fresh cilantro if you had any of the green onions and cilantro left. You can also just do this instead of adding the queso and shredded cheese to crockpot."
- "Also, you can serve with rice as I listed above, tostitos, or cut some tortilla bread in triangles, or make a taco or quesadilla out of it."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
