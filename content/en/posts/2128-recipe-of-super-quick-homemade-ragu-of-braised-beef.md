recipeingredient:
- "3 beef shank"
- "1 onion diced"
- "1 carrot diced"
- "1 celery stalk diced"
- "2 cup sliced mushrooms"
- "1/2 bell pepper any kind"
- "3/4 cup red wine"
- "1/2 tsp pepper"
- "2 clove minced garlic"
- "1 salt to taste"
- "2 tbsp tomatoe paste"
- "1 tsp paprika"
- "1/2 tsp dried oregano"
- "3 tbsp olive oil"
- "3 cup beef stock chicken stock will be fine"
- "1 pasta that can catch all the rag goodness"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325°F. Meanwhile prep your veggies."
- "Get your oil into a Dutch oven (ex. Le Creuset). Heat oil on high heat. Make 3 slits to the side of the shanks through the fat to prevent curling when searing. Salt both sides of your beef shanks. Sear shanks until golden on each side. About 60 seconds each side. Do each shank at a time to not overcrowd pot. Place meat on a plate off to the side."
- "Turn heat down to medium high. Add onions, garlic, bell peppers, celery, carrots to the same pot used for meat. Do not change out oil. All the flavor is there. Cook for a couple minutes til softened. I would salt this portion as well so all layers of the dish have seasoning. Add your oregano, pepper and paprika as well."
- "Add tomatoe paste and stir into veggies. Add wine to deglaze the pot making sure to scrape all the bits from the bottom. Cook for about 2 min until alcohol has cooked off."
- "Place meat back into Dutch oven including all the juices on the plate. Add beef stock to pot."
- "Cover with lid and cook in oven for 2 hours on 335°F. After 2 hours, raise temp to 350 and take lid off. Continue to cook for another 30 min to evaporate some of the braising liquid."
- "When complete, take each shank out onto a cutting board. Remove the bone and any fat on the sides. Chop the meat into 1/2 inch pieces or simply shred with your fingers. It will be so soft!"
- "With a hand blender, tilt Dutch oven and blend the braising liquid inside the pot. Make sure to pulse so you can leave it a bit chunky. No baby food here. Think rustic!"
- "Add meat back into pot, stir, taste, adjust seasoning if needed. Serve over your favorite pasta. Make sure there are plenty of openings or curves in your pasta choice to absorb all the ragù. Spaghetti won&#39;t work for this one."
- "If you really like it saucy use less pasta. If you like it to just coat the pasta then use more. It&#39;s up to you! I recommend tossing the pasta with the ragù. This way the flavors will penetrate into the pasta."
- "Grate some fresh parmesan over the top for a final touch!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
