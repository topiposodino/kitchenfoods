- "1 large carrot cut into 18inch thick slices on the bias or dont cut it on the bias  whatever works for you"
- "1.5-2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thigh meat or breast if you prefer cut into roughly 1inch cubes"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 Tablespoon minced garlic about 2 large cloves garlic"
- "2 Tablespoons oil"
- "2 Tablespoons oyster sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon sriracha"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 Tablespoon distilled white vinegar"
- " optional 13 cup of peanuts or cashews roasted or raw  whichever you prefer"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, mix the chicken with the kosher salt thoroughly and evenly and set aside."
- "In another small bowl, combine the oyster sauce, sriracha, sugar, and distilled white vinegar and mix thoroughly."
- "Heat a wok, skillet, or large saute pan to high, add 1 Tablespoon oil, and quickly stir fry the onion, carrot, and celery for about 2 minutes or until the onion just begins to turn translucent. Set the veg aside on a plate."
- "Heat your pan back up to high heat, add 1 Tablespoon of oil, and spread chicken in a single layer on the cooking surface and let it cook undisturbed for about 2.5 to 3 minutes. Give the chicken a stir to redistribute and cook 2 more mins or so. (Home ranges rarely get hot enough to stir fry this quantity of meat at a time without generating moisture, so it&#39;s actually better to leave the meat at the high heat and let it develop a sear before you stir it.)"
- "Stir in garlic and let it cook for about 30 seconds."
- "Add in vegetables and sauce mixture and toss to evenly season your stir fry."
- "Enjoy with some steamed rice, noodles/pasta, or as a lettuce wrap filling (or whatever makes your tummy happy). :)"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
