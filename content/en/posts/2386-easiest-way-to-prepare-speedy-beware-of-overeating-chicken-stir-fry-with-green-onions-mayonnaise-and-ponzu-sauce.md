recipeingredient:
- "2 pieces Chicken thigh or breast meat"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Katakuriko"
- "2 tbsp Mayonnaise for stir frying  see directions regarding using reducedfat mayonnaise"
- "1 tbsp Mayonnaise to season"
- "1 Green onion chopped"
- "2 tbsp Ponzu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the chicken into easy to eat pieces. The chicken in the photo is diced, but I recommend cutting it into thin diagonal slices, which cooks faster. Rub the ☆ seasonings, and let rest for 10 minutes or more (using a plastic bag would be handy). Coat the chicken with katakuriko."
- "Add the mayonnaise for stir frying in a pan and turn on the heat. When the mayonnaise starts to melt, add the chicken."
- "Brown the chicken over medium-high heat. Don&#39;t stir or move around the pieces too much. When the surface has browned, turn the heat down a little, cover with a lid and cook the chicken through."
- "Reduced fat mayonnaise doesn&#39;t melt and forms lumps, so don&#39;t use it."
- "If using reduced fat mayonnaise and it clumps up, just keep stir-frying constantly and then add the chicken. Enough oil will come out of the mayonnaise and it will taste great."
- "If a lot of fat comes out (of the mayonnaise or chicken), just wipe it with paper towels to prevent the meat from getting soggy."
- "Add more mayonnaise (to season) and ponzu sauce as well as the chopped green onion, and mix everything together briskly."
- "If you brown the chicken properly to start with, the mayonnaise and ponzu sauce added at the end will cling to the pieces nicely, and they&#39;ll be very tasty."
- "Tip: melt the mayonnaise for stir frying completely before adding the chicken."
- "Tip no. 2: the mayonnaise added at the end for flavor doesn&#39;t need to be heated. Just mix it lightly in and turn off the heat."
- "Another tip: try adding 2 finely minced garlic cloves to the melted mayonnaise. Saute slowly over low heat to bring out the fragrance, then add the chicken."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
