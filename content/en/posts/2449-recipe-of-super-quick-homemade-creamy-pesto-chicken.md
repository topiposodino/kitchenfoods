recipeingredient:
- "1 cup packed fresh basil leaves"
- "2 cloves garlic"
- "1/4 cup toasted walnuts halves"
- "1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
- "8 chicken thighs bonein and skinon"
- "1 cup vegetable stock"
- "1/4 cup creme fraiche can be replaced with sour cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the pesto ahead of time by adding the first four ingredients to a food processor. Add a small pinch of salt and a glug of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse, adding more olive oil as necessary, until you get a lightly chunky, not-too-thick but not-too-runny sauce."
- "Trim the excess fat and skin from the chicken thighs and season them with salt and pepper. Put them uncovered in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight."
- "Add a small splash of olive oil (the regular stuff, not the extra virgin) to a large pan on medium-low heat. Lay the thighs in skin-side down and let fry gently for 20 minutes. They&#39;ll only be flipped once, so make sure the skin-side is as browned and crisped and cooked as possible. About halfway through, remove any excess grease. You only want about a tablespoon or so in the pan."
- "Flip the thighs over and let fry for another 2 or 3 minutes, then add the veg stock. Turn the heat up to medium and simmer until only a few tbsp liquid remains, about 15 minutes."
- "Check your chicken with a thermometer. If it reads 165 F, remove the thighs. If a little under, leave them in the pan to finish. Stir in the creme fraiche and 3 heap tbsp pesto (save the rest in the fridge to use for other things, like pizza!). Let the sauce simmer a final 1 to 2 minutes to reduce a bit, then serve."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
