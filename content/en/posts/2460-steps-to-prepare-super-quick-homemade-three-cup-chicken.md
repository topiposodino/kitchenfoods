- "1 lb chicken wings and drumsticks"
- "3 tbsp black sesame sauce"
- "1/4 cup soy sauce"
- "1/3 cup rice wine"
- "1-1/2 tbsp sugar"
- "2 cups Taiwanese Basil"
- "12 slices ginger"
- "8 cloves garlic"
- "1 small chili pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Thinly slice the ginger. You can either peel the skin or leave the skin on but make sure to wash the skin very thoroughly."
- "Get 8 gloves of garlic and peel of the skin. You can use more ginger, garlic and basil if you’d like. It will just make the dish more flavorful."
- "Cut a small pepper in half"
- "Heat up your wok and add 3 cups of sesame oil. Next, add in the ginger slices and fry on medium-low heat for a few minutes or so."

- "Pour in 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup rice wine, 1-1/2 tablespoon sugar, and the chili. Stir well"
- "Cover the wok and let everything cook on medium-high heat for about 5 to 6 minutes. The sauce will simmer down and get thicker. Occasionally stir the chicken to make sure it’s fully coated with the sauce."
- "After 5 minutes, add the basil and stir it well. Cover with the lid again and let everything simmer for about 10 seconds. This will help the basil release its fragrance."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
