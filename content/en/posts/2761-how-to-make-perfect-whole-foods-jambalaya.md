- "12 links Sabatinos Paleo chicken sausages thinly sliced into rounds"
- "4 bell peppers cored and diced 1 red 1 yellow"

- "8 cups chicken broth"
- "4 cups uncooked rice"
- "4 Tbsp Cajun seasoning"
- "2 tsp dried thyme crushed"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 pound peeled raw shrimp tails removed"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 Tbsp black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mince raw bacon (I use cooking scissors) in a stock pot or deep sauce pan. Cook over medium heat until browned. Set bacon aside and drain all but 1 Tbsp grease. Add 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil to the bacon grease and add the sliced sausages. Cook until lightly browned. Set sausages aside with bacon."
- "Add the remaining 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil to pot. Add bell peppers, celery, onion, and garlic. Sauté until the onions are softened."
- "Add the crushed tomatoes, chicken stock, rice, Cajun seasoning, thyme, cayenne, and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer. Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes (so rice doesn’t burn), until the rice is cooked through. It really will burn if not stirred regularly. If you want to avoid all the stirring, do this step in the crockpot."
- "Remove the bay leaf. Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are cooked through and pink. Stir in the sausages and bacon."
- "Season to taste with salt, pepper, and additional Cajun seasoning if needed. Remove from heat."
- "Serve warm with your desired garnishes and hot sauces."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
