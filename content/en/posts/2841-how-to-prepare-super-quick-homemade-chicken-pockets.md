- "Mix chicken, milk, cream cheese, minced onion, pimentos, salt and pepper in bowl. Mix it and slap it.  Ok, don’t slap it. Unless you did, then bravo for following the directions. But just to be clear, no slapping.   *Tip: Remember that chicken breast recipe I shared last week? This would be a good time to use it."

- "Fold dough to cover chicken mixture and pinch at the sides to keep mixture in. Diagonal, square, whatever. Roll the dough to cover the mixture completely. It might not look pretty but we are not pastry chefs Stacey!   Disclaimer: “Stacey” is a fictional character we made up that sticks her nose up at ugly dough."

- "Bake in 350 F degree oven for 20 minutes. Take out and let rest on counter for at least 5-10 minutes. Enjoy!   *Tip: Remember the comfy pants I mentioned earlier. This is when you will thank me for this tip. Rog had one and then came back into the kitchen for another. They are addicting!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
