recipeingredient:
- "1 whole roasting chicken about 1 12 kg"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/2 tsp onion powder"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1/2 cup lingonberry jam Ikea calls it a spread"
- "2 tbsp apple cider vinegar"
- "1/2 shallot minced"
- "1/2 tsp red pepper flakes"
- "1 tsp fresh mint finely chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "A day in advance, pat the chicken dry and season it liberally with salt. Don&#39;t forget to season inside the cavity. Leave the bird uncovered overnight in the fridge, someplace it can&#39;t be disturbed. This will dry out the skin while simultaneously moistening the meat."
- "Pull the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking so it can come up to room temperature. Combine the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper with a few tbsp veg oil until it forms a runny paste. Rub or brush the spice paste all over the chicken."
- "Preheat your oven to 375 F. When ready, put the chicken on a baking tray with a rack and roast for 1 1/2 hrs, or until the thickest part of the bird reads 165 F. Let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes before carving."
- "Prep the sauce by melting the lingonberry jam in a small saucepot over medium-low heat. Add the vinegar, shallot, pepper flakes, a good pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Let cook for 2 minutes. Finish by stirring in the fresh mint and a couple of tbsp water to loosen it. Serve warm with the chicken."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
