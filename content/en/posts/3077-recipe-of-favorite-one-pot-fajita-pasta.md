Cook pasta, uncovered in a large pot of boiling water. This chicken fajita pasta is a combination of three things that we love; chicken fajitas, pasta, and one pot meals! So many one pot meals I see around the internet call for adding cooked pasta to the pot… which means you had to use another pot to actually COOK that pasta. Cooking pasta in one pot with the sauce takes a little longer than it would if you boiled it on its own. Make sure to give the pot the occasional stir while Use wholemeal pasta to up to the fibre content.
