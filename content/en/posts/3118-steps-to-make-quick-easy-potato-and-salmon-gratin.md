- "200 ml Water"
- "2 pieces  Cream stew roux block"

- "1 as much to taste Pizza cheese"
- "1 dash if needed Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the potatoes into 5 mm slices then into bite sized pieces. Saute in butter lightly and season with salt and pepper. Add the milk. Simmer the potatoes until they&#39;ve absorbed almost all of the milk."
- "Add water and the soup stock cube to the pan. When it comes to a boil, add the cream stew roux and salmon and mix quickly. Make a sauce that&#39;s thicker than the usual cream stew."
- "Line the bottom of a small casserole or gratin dish with bread. If you toast it beforehand, it will be light and spongy; if you don&#39;t toast it, it will be soft and doughy. Choose whichever you prefer."
- "Put the cooked ingredients from Step 2 in the casserole or gratin dish."
- "Top with melting cheese and bake in an oven for 5-10 minutes. Done."
- "If you use salted salmon, it will be too salty. If using salted salmon, use less roux and more milk to adjust the taste."
- "If you use stew roux, you can omit the soup cube. If you don&#39;t use it, saute butter and flour together to make a roux and then make bechamel sauce, or just thicken the sauce with katakuriko dissolved in water."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
