- "Half a chicken breast"
- "2-3 tbsp. teriyaki sauce storebought or homemade"

- " Lettuce Separate the leaves rinse and dry"
- " Pineapple"
- "sheets Nori"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut pineapple into pieces, about 2 inches by 1 and a half inches"
- "For the chicken breast, slice again the grain. You want each piece of chicken to be about 1/3” thick and about 3-1/2” by 3-1/2” in shape."
- "Transfer the chicken to a clean container and add 2 to 3 tbsp of teriyaki sauce. Marinade the chicken for at least 1 hour. The chicken will taste even better if you marinate overnight."
- "After marinating, fry the chicken with some oil in a frying pan. Fry both sides until the chicken becomes golden brown. Remember to check inside to make sure the chicken is cooked throughout."
- "Pan-fry the pineapple slices until they caramelize."
- "Let both the chicken and pineapple cool off so you can easily wrap the onigirazu"
- "Lay a piece of saran wrap on a flat surface. Then, place a piece of the nori sheet."
- "Next, scoop ½ cup of rice onto the nori sheet. Try to form a square with your rice at a 45-degree angle in the middle of the nori sheet. The square should be around 3-1/2” x 3-1/2”."
- "Place 2 to 3 pieces of lettuce on top of the rice. Add 2 pieces of grilled pineapple and 2 to 3 pieces of chicken on the top"
- "Drizzle with some teriyaki sauce. Finish off with a layer of 1/2 cup of rice."
- "To wrap the onigirazu, using both hands, start folding all the corners of the nori sheet towards the center. Fold gently but tightly. When all four corners are folded in, the onigirazu will have a square shape with a height no taller than 1 and a half inches."
- "Mark which way you would cut in half with a thin piece of vegetable. Let the onigirazu sit for about 10 sec and then cut in half following your mark. Wet the knife before cutting will prevent the rice from sticking, allows you to have a clean cut."
