recipeingredient:
- "1 Pack Wonton Wrappers"
- "2 Chicken Breasts Shredded"
- " Favorite BBQ Rub"
- "1/4 Cup Water"
- "1 Tsp Dried Basil"
- "1/2 Tsp Corn Starch"
- "Pinch Salt"
- "Pinch Pepper"
- "1 Brick Cream Cheese room temperature"
- "1/2 Cup Celery  Chopped"
- "1/2 Cup Shredded Carrots"
- "1/2 Cup Buffalo Sauce"
- " Frying oil of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375째F and cook seasoned chicken until it has an internal temperature of 165째F. I season the chicken with a BBQ Rub."
- "Take cream cheese out of the fridge to soften and warm, making it easier to make the mixture."
- "Shred Chicken when it&#39;s done in whatever fashion you choose (I pulse it in my blender)"
- "If chicken is still warm, let it cool."
- "Cut celery and carrots and place both into a large bowl. Add cream cheese, dried Basil and a pinch of salt/pepper."
- "Next add chicken and Buffalo sauce and mix well."
- "Mix water and corn starch into a small bowl and lay out multiple Wonton wrappers"
- "Put about a teaspoon sized scoop of the mixture onto each Wonton wrapper."
- "Wet half of the Wonton wrapper edge with the corn starch water. Fold Wonton wrapper in half and pinch/plete edges to seal. Place them onto a large sheet for transport. When setting them down on the sheet, press down slightly to create a flat bottom."
- "Repeat the process until all Wrappers are full or you run out of mixture. Leftover mixture is great on crackers or with Tortilla chips."
- "Next, you have the choice of a more traditional dumpling (half fry and half steamed) or deep frying the dumpling. I&#39;ll explain both:"
- "For Traditional, you&#39;ll put about 1/4&#34; of oil in the bottom of your pan and heat over medium heat. Place the dumplings on to fry the bottom of the dumplings."
- "Once the bottom is fried to a crisp light brown, add about 1/4 cup of water and cover immediately (the water and oil mixture will spatter when they contact each other, so have the lid ready). Let it steam covered for 1-2 minutes, then remove the dumpling and let them dry."
- "For fully deep fried dumplings (which is what I&#39;ll be doing), fill the pan with about 3/4&#34; of fryer oil and heat over medium heat. Once the oil is ready, place dumplings in and deep fry. They only take about a minute and once they&#39;re done, remove them into a pan to dry"
- "Note: these will stick to paper towel, so it&#39;s best to dry them on a cookie sheet or something similar (like a plate)"
- "After they&#39;re dry, go ahead and eat! Optionally, these taste great dipped in Ranch Dressing, but normally I eat them as is!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
