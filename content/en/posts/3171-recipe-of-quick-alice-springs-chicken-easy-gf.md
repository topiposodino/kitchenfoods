recipeingredient:
- "4 large chicken breast butterfly if thick"
- "1 lb thick sliced bacon"
- "1 medium to large onion diced"
- "5 fresh mushrooms sliced long ways or small can of sliced"
- "1 1/2 cup shredded cheese Mexican blend"
- "3 tbs olive oil or enough to saute onions and mushrooms"
- "2 tbs minced garlic"
- "1 cup Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce more to cover chicken"
- "1 tbsp Kens Honey Mustard"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a covered dish add barbecue sauce to bottom to cover. Place your de-thawed chicken breast in the container and cover with remaining barbecue sauce ensuring that all your chicken is covered. Let the chicken marinate for minimum of 12 hours. *Tip - If you are using large (thick) chicken breast, it would be best to butterfly and cut so when you cook, they all cook evenly."
- "Cook up your bacon and set aside. I have done both ways, cooking on the stove top and also in the oven. The oven provides a clean, evenly cooked and perfectly crispy bacon plus the clean up is EASY. Just line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and place your strips, making sure the strips do not overlap. Cook at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The stove top method will provide plenty of drippings to use for sauteing your onions and mushrooms, if you use this method you can omit the 3 tbsp. of oil"
- "In a non-stick frying pan, add the olive oil or enough oil to saute your onions and mushrooms. Add your ingredients including the onions, mushrooms and garlic. Saute until the onions are mostly clear and or starting to darken around the edges."
- "I use two methods of cooking the chicken. On the outdoor grill and also on a broiling pan. If cooking your chicken on the grill heat up your grill to between 200 and 250, any higher will cook the chicken fast and dry it out. When you remove the chicken from the grill grates, use a pan to pull them off, you will use the same pan to place it back on the grill after building your Alice Springs Chicken. The other method is placing your chicken in the oven on a broiling pan at 350 degrees for 20 to 2"
- "Building the Alice Springs Chicken. With your chicken breast cooked, grab your saute mix, and bacon. Top each piece of chicken with a few pieces of bacon and then top with the saute mix - a couple of spoonfuls should be good. Using the underside of the spoon push the mix and bacon down enough to create a fairly even surface (I know this can be tricky but it&#39;s doable). Now top the chicken with the shredded cheese. Do what you can to add enough cheese smothering the surface.  *Tip - moving the chi"
- "Plate up your chicken - this pairs well with Garlic Mashed potatoes and a nice side salad. We have also had it with rice and steamed veggies."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
