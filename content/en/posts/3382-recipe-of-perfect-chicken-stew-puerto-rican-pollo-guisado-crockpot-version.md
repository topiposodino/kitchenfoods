recipeinstructions:

Then add the chicken bouillon, sazon packets, oregano, and bay leaves. Bring to boil, scraping the drippings off the bottom of the pan with whisk."
- "Pour mixture to crockpot. Sprinkle pimento olives on top. Cook on high for 3 hours. Turn crockpot to low. Add potatoes and carrots. Cook veggies until tender for about one more hour."
- "In the end, whisk 1 cup cold water and cornstarch. Add to crockpot then stir to incorporate. Will slightly thicken it. Serve over rice."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
