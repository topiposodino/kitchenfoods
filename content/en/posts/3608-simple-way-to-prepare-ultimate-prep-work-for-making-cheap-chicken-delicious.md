recipeingredient:
- "1 Chicken breast"
- "1 tbsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle the chicken all over evenly with 1 tablespoon salt, and knead well. Place into a sieve or onto a net, and let sit for 10 minutes to get rid of any excess water or foul odors."
- "Cheap chicken may have a bit of feathers and hide remaining, so make sure to remove it all. Rinse off the salt in water once 10 minutes have passed."
- "Immediately wipe with a paper towel."
- "The osmotic pressure of the salt will pull out the water, so just doing this will make the color of the meat much darker, and the meat will tighten up!"
- "If you sever the thick tendons, then you won&#39;t have to worry about them, and the meat wont shrink when cooked."
- "I don&#39;t like the tendons either, and it is easy to remove them here. Use a knife to strip them off if they are a little difficult to remove."
- "I don&#39;t like the fat that is under the skin, so I always get rid of it if there is any."
- "You will be able to take off quite a bit of fat from under the skin. You are now done with the preparations! Feel free to use it in various recipes!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
