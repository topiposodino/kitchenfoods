recipeinstructions:
- "In our house, all soups start with the same basic formula (onion, celery, carrot, garlic and bone broth- Love ya mom!). Gather these ingredients and find a heavy pot (we use a cast iron stock pot), but use what you have."
- "Prepare your protein (chicken in this case) by searing it in butter or any oil you choose covered (in the soup pot if you want to save on dishes!). This step helps the protein to retain its natural moisture content and prevent that rubbery texture of say...of boiled chicken, yuck!"
- "Remove the chicken and let it cool. Toss it into a bowl, plate etc."
- "Add a bit more butter/oil to the pot, set to medium heat and toss in the diced onion, carrot, celery till tender (5 mins or so), then add chopped garlic for a minute or two... stirring so it doesn&#39;t burn. We stay on medium heat for the rest of the process."
- "Add stock. Add leftovers. Add chicken. Add spices and whatever else you want to the pot."
- "Simmer for a few... 10-20 minutes depending on what you had for leftovers. Taste test. Serve hot. (Maybe with an ice cube for the littles)"
- "Enjoy with fam."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
