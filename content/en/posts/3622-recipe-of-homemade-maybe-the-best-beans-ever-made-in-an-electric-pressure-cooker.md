recipeingredient:
- "1 lb dried pinto beans"
- "2 smoked ham hocks"
- "1 tbs olive oil"
- "1 small onion  chopped"
- "1 tbs minced garlic"
- "2 tbs powdered chicken bullion"
- "6 cups water  more for prep soak"
- "to taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep your beans: Several hours ahead of time sort beans to remove any broken/bad beans and dirt clumps. Rinse beans in a colander under cold running water. Transfer to a bowl. Add enough hot water to cover beans by about 2 inches. Allow to soak 2-4hrs."
- "When ready to cook: drain beans in colander (discard soaking water) and rinse under cold running water. Set beans aside."
- "Turn on your pressure cooker to brown/saute. When heated add 1 tbs olive oil. Add onion and garlic. Cook 2 minutes, stirring with a non-metal spoon often. Add chicken bullion. Stir to coat onions and garlic. Do NOT add salt/pepper before cooking."
- "Add beans to pot. Stir to combine. Nestle ham hocks into beans and pour 6 cups water over everything. Lock lid in place. Ensure steam valve is in the sealed position. Switch cooker over to the chili/bean setting. Set time to 50 minutes."
- "When time is up let rest 15 minutes. Carefully open steam valve to quick release pressure (use a kitchen utensil for safety). When pressure is fully released (steaming stops) carefully remove lid."
- "Use tongs to remove ham hocks to a plate. Use a slotted spoon to transfer about 1 cup of beans to a medium bowl. Mash beans into a paste. Stir bean paste back into beans in pot to help thicken."
- "If desired, de-bone and chop up ham hocks (meat, fat, skin and all) and stir back in to beans. We do this for added flavor and richness. Stir in desired amounts of salt and pepper. Serve with cornbread and enjoy!"
- "See notes below ⤵"
- "Note: If beans still seem to &#34;soupy&#34; for your liking after stirring in the mashed beans (and possibly ham hocks) turn cooker back onto brown/saute to bring beans back to a simmer. Simmer with lid off until desired thickness is achieved."
- "Note: For a tasty cornbread to go along with these beans see one of the 2 recipes on my page!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
