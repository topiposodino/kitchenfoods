- "Transfer the chicken into the pan with the sweet and spicy sauce and coat all over. Transfer onto a serving plate and sprinkle with sesame seeds and nuts (use either or add both). Eat as a snack along with other side dish accompaniments such as a salad, chips or sweet potato fries. Serve hot and enjoy."
