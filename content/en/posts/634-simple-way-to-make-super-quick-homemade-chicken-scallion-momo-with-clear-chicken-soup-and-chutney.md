recipeinstructions:
- "For Chicken Scallion Momo:  Put everything in the bowl for stuffing except salt and mix. Keep it in fridge while you make the dough ready. Add salt and mix when you are about to make otherwise it will release water. Shift the flour, knead it into tight dough so that no extra flour is needed to roll it. Cover and let it rest for at least 20-30 mins."
- "Now take small dough pieces and roll it like a Puri keeping the edges thin and keep the stuffing in the centre and fold it and press the edges to seal the momo/ dumpling.  Arrange and keep it in a greased /oiled momo steamer and steam it for 30 minutes. Serve hot with soup and Garlic Tomato chutney, Cilantro Tomato Chutney, Schezwan Chutney etc."
- "Chicken Clear Soup: Add all the ingredients in the steamer base vessel along with enough water. Make about 1.5 -2 litres hot water ready in another pot or electric kettle to add as and when required. Start making the soup an hour before, so that when you steam momo you can steam with the soup only and your soup is also ready to serve when your Momo is ready."
- "Wash the Cilantro thoroughly, grind it along with salt, garlic and chilli and then add the roasted or boiled &amp; peeled tomato and grind again and blend well. Check salt and add if needed. I had added two Garlic cloves initially but I felt it less so I added two more when I added the tomatoes because I love garlic, you can adjust garlic and chilli as per your taste. Serve it with momo. It goes well with Parathas too and even Dal Bhaat (Dal &amp; Rice)."
- "Garlic Tomato Chutney:  Fire roast or boil the Tomatoes (if boiling boil for 20 minutes after cutting the top portion and making 2-3 slits on the tomatoes so that it peels off easily and boil the whole dry Chillies too along with it. If roasting directly, roast in fire ( gas stove or charcoal fire), in this case soak the chilli for an hour in hot water, so that the dry chillies soften up and it&#39;s easy to grind ).  Whatever you do peel the tomatoes before grinding."
- "Put everything in the mixer grinder and grind it into fine paste. Adjust salt. Serve with Momo, Parathas, Pakodas etc."
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
