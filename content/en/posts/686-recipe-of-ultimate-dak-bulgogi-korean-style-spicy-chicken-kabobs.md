recipeingredient:
- "12-15 bamboo skewers soaked in water for at least an hour"
- "2-2.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into roughly 15inch cubes to the extent that you can cut chicken thigh meat into cubes which is to say not really"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic about 3 cloves"
- "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root or you could use about 14 teaspoon dry ginger powder"
- "1 green onion finely chopped"
- "1/8 cup sugar"
- "1/8 cup gochujang Korean red chili paste You can substitute with sriracha  not quite the same but youll get a tasty result"
- "1/8 cup low sodium soy sauce"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1.5 Tablespoons neutral oil like vegetable canola grapeseed"
- "1 large onion cut into 1 pieces for skewering and tossed with 2 teaspoonfuls of oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the onion, making sure to incorporate all of them thoroughly."
- "Cover the bowl and set in the fridge to marinate (about 1 hour ideally, and not more than 2). Remember to take the meat out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you&#39;re ready to grill.  If you&#39;re using a charcoal grill, start your coals about 20 to 25 minutes before you want to grill. You want a gentle, medium low heat over which to cook these kebabs.  If gas, just pre-heat your grill to medium low 5 to 7 minutes before cooking."
- "Skewer your kabobs so they look like this.  6 single layers of onion with 5 roughly 1&#34;layers of chicken skewered between them. As you&#39;ve probably discovered by now, it&#39;s a little challenging to get 1&#34; cubes of meat from chicken thighs, but you generally want a 1&#34; thickness of meat between veg, so you might have to add odd pieces of chicken to the bigger ones to achieve this thickness.  I used only onions mostly because I think it tastes simple and delicious this way."
- "Over a medium low grill, cook the kebabs about 15 minutes, covered, turning them every 5 minutes."
- "Enjoy!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
