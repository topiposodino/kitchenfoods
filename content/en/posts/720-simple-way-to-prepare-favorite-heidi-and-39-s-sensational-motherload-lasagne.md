recipeinstructions:
- "In a large frying pan cook onion and garlic until soft. Add mince to pan and cook until brown"
- "Add bolognaise sauce and tomato soup to pan. The tomato soup gives a great flavour. Simmer gently"
- "Add vegetables. I have a food processor and blitz zucchini, carrot, broccoli and cauliflower until they&#39;re extremely fine and can be hidden in the sauce so the kids don&#39;t notice"
- "While the meat sauce is simmering, place butter in large pot over cook top until almost melted and add corn flour, stirring with a whisk for approximately 1 min until you get a nice yellow roux"
- "Add the milk, 1 cup at a time, whisking in between to rid any lumps. Add in cream, cheese sauce, vegeta, salt and pepper to taste. Keep this simmering for 5 or so mins until it thickens. Stir through cheese until melted"

- "Sprinkle extra cheese on top and cook, covered with aluminium foil in an oven preheated to 200°C for half hour. Remove foil and cook for a further 15 mins until the lasagne is bubbling and golden brown on top. Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 mins before serving"
- "This recipe makes 2 large lasagnas so halve if you only want one. I slice and freeze one up for lazy nights and freeze the left over meat sauce in batches for when I make spaghetti bolognaise or as a base for sloppy Joe&#39;s etc so it&#39;s economical"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
