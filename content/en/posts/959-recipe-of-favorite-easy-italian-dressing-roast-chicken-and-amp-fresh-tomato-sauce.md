- " For the chicken"
- "3 lbs bonein skinon chicken drums andor thighs scored twice on the skin side down to the bone about 2long and 1 apart"

- "1 small yellow onion chopped"
- "3 Tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 Tablespoon dried Italian herbs OR 3 Tablespoons chopped fresh herbs"
- "1/2 teaspoon sugar if needed to round out the acid in the dressing"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken and dressing mixture and toss gently several times to coat the chicken thoroughly. Take some of the run off dressing mixture and work it into each score. Let the chicken sit while you&#39;re preparing the tomato sauce components."
- "In your roasting pan, add all the tomato sauce components and give them a few good stirs to evenly distribute all the ingredients and seasonings."
- "Lay your chicken skin side up atop the tomato mixture, leaving a little space between the pieces. Make sure to put any leftover marinade into the pan, too."

I&#39;m a big fan of the cold, shallow water method."
- "After 60 minutes, sprinkle the grated cheese in equal portions atop the chicken pieces, and put it back on the top rack of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. (Check at the 10 minute mark to see if it&#39;s done to your liking or if it could use just a few more minutes in the oven.)"
- "I like to put the chicken on its own platter and serve the pasta on the side and just spoon the tomato sauce, broth and all, over the pasta."
- "Enjoy!"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
