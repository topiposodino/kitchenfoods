recipeingredient:
- "4 pounds bonein skinon chicken pieces patted dry"
- "2.5-3 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "3-4 cloves garlic grated or 2 teaspoons garlic powder not garlic salt"
- " zest of 1 lemon"
- " juice of 1 lemon about 2 to 25 Tablespoons"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 Tablespoon dried herbs of choice I like any combo of parsley thyme rosemary or 3 Tbsp finely chopped fresh herbs"
- "3 Tablespoons olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly in a large mixing bowl with your hands (it&#39;s difficult to ensure that each piece is thoroughly and evenly seasoned if you don&#39;t get in there and do it by feel), and make sure each individual piece of chicken is coated in the seasoning. Marinate for at least an hour and up to 4 or 5 hours in the refrigerator before roasting."
- "45 mins before roasting, take chicken out of the refrigerator and place in a single layer, skin side up, on a broiler pan or other large high oven temp safe vessel, giving each piece of chicken at least a 1/2-inch clearance on each side, and let it come up in temperature before cooking. For best results, place your chicken on a rack that allows for drainage. The more dry heat that reaches the surface of each piece of chicken, the better the sear, the crispier the skin, and the juicier the meat."
- "Preheat oven to 425F/220C."
- "Roast chicken for 45 to 50 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. That&#39;s it!"
- "Enjoy! :)"
- "Ready to serve and ENJOY!"
